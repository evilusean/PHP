Arch Linux Laravel Install (with SQLite) :
sudo pacman -Syu #update system, reboot
sudo pacman -S php php-fpm php-gd php-intl #install all php prerequisites
sudo pacman -S composer #install composer
sudo pacman -S php-sqlite #project will use sqlite
sudo nano /etc/php/php.ini # After installation, you need to enable the extension in your php.ini file. 
# Find the lines for the SQLite extensions and uncomment them by removing the semicolon ; at the beginning of each line. ';extension=pdo_sqlite' ';extension=sqlite3' 
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm #Restart the PHP-FPM service for the changes to take effect.
composer global require laravel/installer # Use Composer to install the Laravel installer globally.
#Add the Composer vendor bin directory to your system's PATH. This allows you to run the laravel command from any directory. The path is typically ~/.config/composer/vendor/bin on Arch Linux.
nano ~/.bashrc # Add the following line to the end of the file: 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"'
source ~/.bashrc #resource, so you can use 'laravel' in terminal anywhere
laravel new your-project-name # will allow you to now create a new project 

Laravel Homestead:
A pre-packaged Vagrant box providing a complete development environment with PHP, Nginx, databases, and other services within a virtual machine.
https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/homestead
https://github.com/laravel/homestead
Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box designed to provide a convenient and consistent development environment for Laravel applications. 
  It eliminates the need to manually install and configure server software like PHP, Nginx, MySQL, and other tools directly on your local machine.
Arch Linux Homestead Install :
sudo pacman -S vagrant 
sudo pacman -S virtualbox
git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git ~/.local/share/homestead
cd ~/.local/share/homestead
git checkout release
bash init.sh
Configure Homestead.yaml: Open the generated ~/.local/share/homestead/Homestead.yaml file and configure it to your needs. 
  This includes setting the provider to virtualbox and mapping your project directories
Add a hosts file entry: Edit your /etc/hosts file with sudo and add an entry that maps your site's domain to the Homestead IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.10).
Installing Laravel Homestead on Arch Linux involves a few key steps. Since Homestead is a pre-configured Vagrant box, 
  you'll first need to install Vagrant and a virtualization provider like VirtualBox.
Open the generated ~/.local/share/homestead/Homestead.yaml file and configure it to your needs. This includes setting the provider to virtualbox and mapping your project directories.
YAML
provider: virtualbox
folders:
    - map: ~/Projects/MyProject
      to: /home/vagrant/MyProject
sites:
    - map: myproject.test
      to: /home/vagrant/MyProject/public
Add a hosts file entry:
Edit your /etc/hosts file with sudo and add an entry that maps your site's domain to the Homestead IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.10).
sudo nano /etc/hosts
# Add this line to the end of the file
192.168.10.10 myproject.test
Launching Homestead :
After all the configurations are complete, you can launch your virtual machine.
Navigate to the Homestead directory:
cd ~/.local/share/homestead
Start the virtual machine:
vagrant up # The first time you run this, Vagrant will download the pre-packaged Laravel Homestead box, which may take some time.
Access the VM: Once it's up, you can SSH into the virtual machine.
vagrant ssh

Add Auth/Login/Registation/Password Recovery to your PHP Laravel project with 2 commands :
'composer require laravel/breeze' # will require and install breeze package, which has everything you need for authentication : registration, login, email verification, password resets, etc
'php artisan breeze:install' # installs breeze into your project update composer.json, package.lock, add tonnes of files(scaffolding) for login, auth, etc, 

Free Hosting For Resume Options :
Render :
Render is an excellent choice as it has very clear, separate free tiers for both web services and PostgreSQL.
  Free Web Service - The free tier for your Laravel app gives you 750 hours of uptime per month. 
  The main limitation is that your service will spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, leading to a slight delay for the first visitor (known as a "cold start").
  The cold start delay for a free Render web service is typically around 30 seconds. This happens because Render spins down your application after 15 minutes of inactivity to save resources. 
  When the next visitor accesses your site, it has to "wake up" the server, which causes the initial delay. After that, the site will be fast for subsequent requests until it goes idle again.
Free PostgreSQL Database: You get a PostgreSQL database with 100MB of storage. This is more than enough for a portfolio project and works seamlessly with your Laravel app.
Railway :
Railway is another solid option with a generous free tier. It operates on a usage-based model with a monthly credit of $5.
  Free Usage: This credit can be applied to both your web application and your PostgreSQL database, so you can run both for free as long as your usage stays within the monthly limit. 
  This is usually sufficient for a portfolio project.
Major Cloud Providers:
Platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure also offer extensive free tiers. 
  However, they are generally more complex to set up and manage than PaaS platforms like Render or Railway, and their free tiers often have a one-year limit.
AWS : 
The AWS Free Tier offers several services with usage limits that can be used to host a full-stack Laravel project, but it is typically only free for the first 12 months.
Key Free Services - The free tier includes services for both your backend and frontend.
For the Backend:
Amazon EC2: You get 750 hours per month of a t2.micro or t3.micro instance. This is enough to run your Laravel application 24/7 for a month.
Amazon RDS: You get 750 hours per month of a single db.t2.micro database instance, which can host your PostgreSQL database. This is also enough to run your database continuously.
For the Frontend:
Amazon S3: You receive 5 GB of standard storage. This is perfect for hosting your frontend as static files (like a React or Vue SPA).
Amazon CloudFront: A content delivery network (CDN) that you can use to serve your frontend and static assets faster globally, with a free tier of 50 GB of data transfer.
Hosting a Full-Stack Project :
Yes, the AWS Free Tier can host both a Laravel backend and a frontend. The Laravel backend would run on an EC2 instance, while the PostgreSQL database would run on an RDS instance. 
If your frontend is a separate JavaScript application, you can host it as static files in an S3 bucket and serve it with CloudFront.
The main challenge is that setting up all these services and connecting them requires significant technical knowledge and is much more complex than using a simpler Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
  like Render or Railway. 💻
PHP + MySQL :
InfinityFree: A popular and reliable choice that provides 5 GB of disk space, unlimited bandwidth, and multiple MySQL databases with no forced ads.
ProFreeHost: Similar to InfinityFree, this service offers 5 GB of disk space, unlimited bandwidth, and MySQL, all with a promise of no forced ads on your website.
AwardSpace: This service offers a free plan with 1 GB of disk space, 5 GB of bandwidth, and one MySQL database, making it a good starting point for small projects.
000webhost: Powered by Hostinger, 000webhost provides a free plan with a single database, limited disk space, and no forced ads, making it a decent option for learning and development.
Freehostia: With their "Chocolate" free plan, you get 250 MB of disk space, 6 GB of monthly traffic, and one MySQL database, which is suitable for a very small and simple website.
